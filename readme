This is the source code for my (Jianjiong Gao's) Google Summer of Code 2008 project--Advance Network Merge for Cytoscape. In this project, a new Cytoscpae plugin was developed to allow users to merge networks based on attribute values and ID mappings.

To utilize this plugin, a user need to download Cytoscape (www.cytoscape.org) first, and then put the NetworkMerge.jar into the plugins directory. After that, running Cytoscape will automatically load this plugin. Later we will officially release this plugin, and it will be downloadable in the Plugin Manager in Cytoscape. Before releasing, the latest version of this plugin and the corresponding source code are available at http://chianti.ucsd.edu/svn/csplugins/trunk/soc/jgao/NetworkMerge/. Developing documents are available at http://www.cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/Advanced_Network_Merge_and_ID_Mapping.
